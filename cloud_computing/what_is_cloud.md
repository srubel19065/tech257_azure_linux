# What is Cloud Computing
### *'Without the need for physical infrastructure'*
![img.png](img.png)

####  - Cloud Computing is a way to help businesses/ individuals reduce physical hardware by using services that are not theirs
- Resources that are used through the internet without the need to own any of it
- the hardware does not need to managed by the business, so you have a big pool of resources without using your own electricity of hardware
- Diagram:
  - Every hardware device can be used through the cloud


### What can you do with Cloud Computing
1. Data storage and Management
   - File storage and sharing
   - Data backup and archiving
   - e.g: if you lose your iphone, you can use the cloud to restore everything on there
2. Software and Apps
   - can run cloud based software (SaaS)
   - Developing/Deploying apps
     - AWS/Azure; tools to build apps
3. Computing Power and Resources:
   - Scalability/Elasticity
   - High performance computing
4. Collab/Comms


### 4 TYPES OF CLOUD
1. PUBLIC
   - Resources are offered over the internet by cloud providers
     - PROS: Cost-effective, scalable, readily available
     - CONS: Lack of security and control
2. PRIVATE
   - Dedicated cloud env for single-org eg hosted premise or third party provider
     - PROS: Greater control, security, customisation 
     - CONS: Higher costs and need to manage the infrastructure
3. HYBRID
   - Combined pub and priv
4. MULTI-CLOUD
   - using multiple public clouds from different providers simultaneously

### ADVANTAGES
1. Cost-effective (PAYG)
2. Scalability: change in demand 
3. Increased Accesibility: can be accessed anywhere with internet
4. Improved Collab
5. Disaster Recovery: backups and DR solutions

### DISADVANTAGES
1. Security
2. Internet dependancy 
3. Limited control

### OpEx
- The ongoing costs to run the business on a day2day basis
  - keeping revenue and operational eg rent

### CapEx
- Large one time expenses with getting or upgrading physical assets eg building

### 3 largest Cloud Providers
1. AWS
   - Market leader
   - storage, compute, databases
   - EC2 Buckets
2. Azure
3. GCP

### 4 Pillars of DevOps
1. Culture and Collab
   - breaking the obstalcles between different teams with cross-functional teamwork a big highlight
   - open comms and goals
   - Cloud provides tools to communicate better
2. Automation
   - automating repetitive tasks
   - reduces manual error, improves effieciency
   - Cloud: various tools and APIs to help automate 
3. CI/CD
   - frequent code change and deployment
   - faster feedback and better products
4. Monitoring and Feedback
   - Continuously monitoring so issues are always prioritised
