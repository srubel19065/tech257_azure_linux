# Process of Automation

1. Manual
   - lowest level where everything is done yourself
   - e.g. creating the VM AND ssh in
2. Scripting
   - making a script to automate processes but still need to ssh in. 
   - We need to be 100% sure the script works everytime
3. User Data
   - running the vm as root user
   - it only needs to run once and then wont need to be ran again
   - the app folder needs to be in the root
4. IMAGE
   - An image is a snapshot of the operation system, apps, software used to make VMs
   - As you create and config with how you want it, making VMs can be easy and repeatable
